How to register content grabber on Flickr:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Let's write how to get things done on flickr authentication
    for "Photoblog" to sync content with Flickr properly:
    1. You need to "Obtain an API key" for e.g. from here:
    
        http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/
        
    2. Save your KEY and SECRET pair received in the main settings.py file.
        for e.g:
        
        FLICKR_API_KEY = '9a0554259914a86fb9e7eb014e4e5d52'
        FLICKR_API_SECRET = '000005fab4534d05'
        
    3. Add at least 1 Screenshot to your app and at least 1 tag, 
        in order to make your app public.
    
    4. Add your app Callback URL:
    
        for e.g.:   http://yoursite.com/content/callback/
        
       in order flickr to redirect after authentication directly to your site.
